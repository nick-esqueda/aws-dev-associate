WAIT CONDITIONS & CFN-SIGNAL

by default, logical reources will show CREATE_COMPLETE even if your app is not bootstrapped up yet
- e.g. app deployment on an EC2 may be starting up after EC2 is up and running. CFN will show CREATE_COMPLETE - it doesn't know your app is starting up
- e.g. using the UserData section on an EC2 logical resource - script takes long time
wait conditions and cfn-signal help solve above issue

CFN-SIGNAL
cfn-signal command = part of aws-cfn-bootstrap package
helps configure CFN to HOLD/wait for success signals
runs on the actual inst., communicates success/fail back to CFN
wait for X num. of success signals before considering CREATE_COMPLETE
config. a timeout for those X succes signals
- 12 hour max
if X success signals received by CFN, then create_complete
if failure signal received, resource & stack creation fails - CFN will know
if timeout is reached, resource & stack creation fails - CFN will know

CreationPolicy
if a logical resource has a CreationPolicy or uses a WaitCondition (in the template), it can listen to cfn-signal
AWS says to use CreationPolicy for EC2s or ASGs, because it's tied to that specific resource
define the success signal count and timeout in the CreationPolicy section.
- then, that logical resource will wait for those cfn-signal signals

WaitConditions
adds additional functionality to CreationPolicy way of doing it
generally for more complex cfn templates
WaitConditions are useful when integrating CFN with some external/on-prem IT system
WaitConditions are their OWN logical resource, not something defined in an existing resource
WCs can depend on other resources, and other resources can depend on it
acts as a "general progress gate" that can't be passed until right signals are received
WaitConditionHandle = a pre-signed URL that physical resources can comm. with
- they are another separate logical resource 
- pre-signed URL:
  - credentials are config.d in the URL so caller doesn't need any cred.s
  - used by phys. resource to send success/fail signals to
  - phys. resource can also send JSON data back to the cfn template via pre-signed URL!
    - data can be referenced inside the template itself! via !GetAtt WaitCondition.Data
1. define WaitCondition in template
2. define WaitConditionHandle
3. reference WaitConditionHandle inside WaitCondition
4. define Timeout and signal Count in WaitCondition
5. phys. resource creation - stack will wait until WaitHandle gets the signal....
6. phys. resource passes data thru the WaitHandle pre-signed URL
7. data from signal can be populated where referenced in the template
8. stack continues

NESTED STACKS

stacks are standalone contained units. they are isolated from other stacks.
all logical resources in a stack share the same lifecycle.
normal standalone stacks are fine, but may run into some limit. that's where nested stacks OR cross-reference stacks help
nested stacks encourage modular templates that can be reused across infrastructures

! stacks can only have max 500 resources
you can't reuse logical resources across many stacks
- can't reference them - i.e. template only knows the resources in it's own template
nested stacks allow you to overcome the 500 limit - each nested stack can have 500 each

like a tree - "root stack" is the root node
parent stack = any stack that has child stacks

nested stacks are just normal stacks
  - they have inputs and outputs like normal stacks
have to reference the template URL in the parent stack for CFN to build it
parameters - if the nested stack takes in parameters, have to supply those in the parent stack template
  - if nested stack template has defaults for those param.s, then don't have to explicitly pass in
nested stacks outputs
outputs - nested stack can have outputs - can ref these in parent stack, and even pass to other nested stacks
  ! ONLY nested stack OUTPUTS can be referenced. still can't ref the logical res.s in the nested
nested stacks are just other logical resources
  - "AWS::CloudFormation::Stack" resource type

note: when reusing nested stack tempalate, you're reusing the template CODE, not the resources itself created in some other stack created by that template

use nested stacks when:
- the stack will form part of one solution
- all stacks need to share the same lifecycle
  ! if one needs to stay alive longer than the others, then need cross-stack references
- you don't need to reference the logical resources directly (can make use of nested outputs)
- you want to overcome 500 resource limit per stack
- you want code reuse
- make infra startup process easier - just run 1 root stack, and it orchestrates the rest

...
VPCSTACK:
  Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack
  Properties:
    TemplateURL: https://someurl.com/template.yaml
    Parameters:
      Param1: !Ref SomeParam1
      Param2: !Ref SomeParam2
      Param3: !Ref SomeParam3
...

---
CROSS-STACK REFERENCES

a way you can references existing physical resources from another stack

outputs can be EXPORTED. this makes them visible to other stacks
- normally, stack outputs are not visible from other stacks
exports are stored in a region in an account
- export names must be unique in the region
- each region in your acct has it's own dedicated list of exports
- cross-region or cross-account exports are NOT supported
Fn::ImportValue can be used in another template to get an exported output from another stack
- have to use ImportValue instead of !Ref - !Ref is for ref.ing within same template

example: a shared VPC stack - ci/cd pipeline deploys code via CFN to that other stack's VPC to test

cross-stack ref.s are for reusing resources inside a stack,
nested stacks are for reusing templates

use when:
- service oriented architectures
- stacks must have diff. lifecycles
- reuse stack resources

...
Outputs: # Mostly normal outputs section...
  SHAREDVPCID:
    Description: Shared Services VPC
    Value: !Ref SomeVPC
    Export: # ! this Export section is what stores the output in the region's exports list
      Name: SHAREDVPCID # must be acct+regionally unique
...

STACK SETS

deploy stacks across any acct.s & regions
each stack still runs as normal, in 1 region in 1 acct

terminology:
- admin account = the acct. where the stackset is. just used to manage the whole stackset
- target account = an acct. where the stacks will actually run - stackset targets these
- stack instance = references a real stack running in a target acct
  - these are different from stacks - these are just ref.s to the real one
  - exist just to record what happens to each stackset stack in every region/acct
  - are put in the target acct/region
  - kind of like an agent to report back to the admin acct / stackset
  - stacks are only spun up once the stack instances are created
- concurrent accounts = number of accts that will have stacks deployed in them at a time
  - instead of deploying to all at once - slows deploy down, but is more stable
- failure tolerance = how many stack inst.s can fail before stackset is considered failed
- retain stacks = if true, deleting stack inst. doesn't delete real stack - it stays running in each acct/region
  - by default, deleting the stack inst. deletes the real stack

stacksets deploy stacks in other acct.s via roles
- can use service-managed or self-managed roles
- service-managed perm.s are used as part of an AWS org, which target acct.s are members of
- can target organizational units (OUs) or specific acct.s

the template for a stackset is just a normal CFN template
- the stackset deploys the SAME template/stack to each acct/region

useful scenarios:
- to enable AWS Config
- AWS Config rules - configure MFA, EIPS, EBS Encryption, etc.
- create IAM roles at scale instead of 1 by 1 per acct
- create roles for cross-account access

---
DELETION POLICY

by default, if deleting a logical res. from stack or deleting whole stack, all data is deleted
- e.g. all RDS DB data, EB volume data, etc. 

DeletionPolicy allows you to keep the data

can define DeletionPolicy on each res. in a template
DeletionPolicy options:
- Delete (default)
- Retain (don't delete the resource after logical resource/stack deletion)
  - works for any resource
- Snapshot (take a snapshot of the resource before deleting it)
  - only for supported resources: ebs volumes, elasticache, RDS, redshift, neptune
  - NOT supported on EC2, have to do on the EBS volume

! be careful: you keep the data, so have to pay normal $$ for it

! only applies to DELETE operations, not replace
- example: changing a property of a res. that causes it to be replaced

---
STACK ROLES

allows stacks to get the perm.s they need to work w/phys. res.s without the identity creating the stack having those perm.s
i.e. a way to allow identities to interact with res.s through CFN ONLY

! good way to implement role separation

normally CFN uses the perm.s of the LOGGED IN IDENTITY to create physical res.s
- e.g. your perm.s when you log into the console and create a stack
but, what if you (the user who logged in) don't have those perm.s?
instead, CFN could use & assume a role to get the right perm.s without logged-in identity needing them. this is what a stack role is for
the identity creating the stack only needs the PassRole perm.s - doesn't need resource perm.s

1. gabby (acct admin) creates an IAM role
  - IAM role has perm.s to CRUD the res.s used by template
2. gabby gives phil perm.s to CRUD stacks AND to pass the role (PassRole)
  - phil should NOT have perm.s to edit OR assume the role - role separation
  - phil should NOT have perm.s to manipulate phys. res.s
3. phil uses the IAM role when creating the stack
4. role is used by the stack to perform operations on phys. res.s

CLOUDFORMATION INIT (CFN-INIT)

helps with bootstrapping your app on EC2 (easier compared to the UserData feature of EC2)
- UserData - procedural/imperative way - have to list all commands (HOW)
- cfn-init - declarative way - specify WHAT you want, cfn-init does the implementation 
note: specific to ec2 instances

you specify resource metadata under the logical res. in a template/stack
- resource metadata = what the inst. needs for bootstrapping
cfn-init on the EC2 can pull that metadata from the template and perform bootstrapping
idempotent - re-running cfn-init X times will result in same final state
- cfn-init can see what things are installed on the EC2 and not install them again

! only cfn-init runs ONCE - if you update/change the stack & reapply, cfn-init won't run

with cfn-signal: cfn-signal comm.s to the stack based on the status code of cfn-init

/var/log/cloud-init-output.log stores bootstrapping logs - if any app startup issues, check here
- shows the output of the UserData bootstrapping process - any commands in UserData will be shown
- useful even if not using cfn-init - any UserData commands will log here

/var/log/cfn-init-cmd.log
- shows everything cfn-init did - e.g. sudo yum install output logs

/var/log/cfn-init.log
- shows high-level info on what cfn-init did

---
CFN-HUP

helper tool that can run configurable actions when a change in resource metadata is detected
- aka a daemon watching for changes in logical resource metadata in the stack
since cfn-init only runs ONCE, you can use cfn-hup to re-run cfn-init if you update the metadata

! have to install and manage cfn-hup on the inst. yourself (cfn manages cfn-init though)


---
MISC NOTES

if you update the UserData section of a logical resource, the inst. will be stopped & started again
- aka "update with disruption"
- happens even if part of the UserData uses a placeholder for template parameters
- note that your script in UserData will NOT run on EC2 again, even with the change in UserData
! update with disruption will cause EC2 inst.s to lose their IP and get assigned a new one
