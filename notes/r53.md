# Route53

## Route53 Fundamentals

Global service - single DB distributed worldwide
Globally resilient

2 FEATURES:
1. Can register domains
  - R53 has relationships with all major domain registries (TLD registries - .com/.io/etc)
    - each TLD registry hosts the zone files for .com/.io/etc.
2. Can host zones with managed nameservers

note: DNS zones = databases that hold your DNS records (basically)
zones can hold all or some of the DNS records for one domain
- (can split a domain into multiple zones and assign ownership of some zones to other admins)

Domain registration process
1. r53 checks if domain is available
2. r53 crates a zone file for the domain
3. r53 allocates name servers for that zone 
  - usually 4 for each zone, distributed globally
4. communicates with TLD registry & adds the NS records in the zone file for the TLD (.org/.com)
  - the NS records point to the AWS nameservers your zone is on
  - this makes the nameservers "authoritative"

HOSTED ZONES
zone files/zones are called "hosted zones" in AWS
- "hosted zone" because zone files are automatically hosted on nameservers
- AWS always puts your zones on 4 of it's nameservers, hosted globally
kind of viewed at as DNS-as-a-Service

hosted zones can be public or private
- logically, AWS nameservers are hosted on the public part of AWS
- public hosted zones can be accessed by public internet or by VPCs via R53 resolver ("VPC +2" address)
- private hosted zones are hosted and only accessible in a VPC
  - for sensitive DNS records

if you delete & recreate a hosted zone for a domain in AWS, you get 4 brand new nameservers to host the zone - different from the original nameservers
- you can reassign it to the earlier nameservers by modifying the settings in AWS console

domains can be registered by an external service (e.g. squarespace) but hosted on an AWS hosted zone
- have to update the NS records in the 
1. create a domain via some external registrar
2. create hosted zone in AWS
3. update the NS records in the registrar's interface to point to the name servers in the AWS hosted zone

AWS charges you for:
1. hosting the zone file on the hosted zone
2. queries made to the hosted zone


## Private Hosted Zones

Mostly same as public zones, but few diff.s
- NOT public
- must be associated with VPCs
- only accessible within the associated VPCs
- can technically be accessed by diff. accounts using the AWS CLI or API (?)
- split-view feature

Split-view (aka "split-horizon"):
- "overlapping public & private dns"
    - can think of it like 2 different cross-sections of all DNS records
- allows for the same zone name/DNS name to be used for Public AND Private zones
- useful if a business want to use same domain name for public & internal
    - if connected to to company network, then the domain will point to an internal site
- not all DNS records have to be made public with split-view
    - the public zone is usually a subset of all the private zone's DNS records
    - e.g. an A record for accounting, an A record for www 
        - the accounting record is in the private zone, but public zone doesn't include it

## CNAME vs ALIAS Records 

you can't use a CNAME record to map the apex (aka "naked") domain to another DNS name
- can't because DNS itself doesn't support this.
use an ALIAS record to do this.
useful if you want your domain name to point to an ELB's DNS name

! requests using ALIAS pointing to an AWS resource are FREE! no charge 
- default to using ALIAS instead of CNAME in this case always, since you save

ALIAS CNAME vs. ALIAS A record 
- ALIAS is a subtype - can have A record ALIAS and CNAME ALIAS 
- just match the type with the type of record you're pointing at 
    - if it's an A record, use an A record ALIAS 
    - if CNAME record, use an CNAME record ALIAS
- A record ALIASes are used for most svcs - APIGW, CF, EB, ELB, S3

ALIAS records are not part of DNS standard - mainly specific to AWS (squarespace also supports ALIAS records though)

## AWS Simple Routing

there are multiple routing types in R53. simple routing is the simplest/most basic of them.
use when you want to route requests to ONE service, like a web server

- supports 1 record per name (www)
- supports multiple values for each record 
    - can point to multiple IP addresses in 1 A record
    - all values are returned in the DNS query response to the client (random order). client chooses which IP address to request
- doesn't support health checks - always returns record values even if the resource behind the value isn't operational
